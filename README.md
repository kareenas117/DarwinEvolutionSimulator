# DarwinEvolutionSimulator

This project is an interactive simulation inspired by the GalÃ¡pagos Islands and the theory of evolution by natural selection.
It was created to demonstrate how environmental pressures shape the development of species over time â€” helping visualize evolutionary concepts in a dynamic, engaging way.

Originally designed as part of a Theology course project (Human Nature After Darwin), the simulation invites users to explore the impacts of adaptation, survival, and chance on different species, encouraging reflection on the relationship between science and views of human nature.

Features
ðŸŽ® Interactive Gameplay: Users make decisions that affect the survival of different species.

ðŸ§¬ Evolutionary Outcomes: Multiple short-term and long-term consequences based on user choices.

ðŸŒŽ Real-World Inspirations: Mechanics based on real evolutionary principles observed in the GalÃ¡pagos Islands.

ðŸ“– Interdisciplinary Reflection: Blends scientific understanding of evolution with theological questions about human uniqueness and change.

Why This Project Matters
This simulation was developed not only to illustrate evolution but also to provoke deeper thinking about:

How Darwinâ€™s theory challenges traditional theological views of fixed human nature.

How life adapts continuously, reflecting a dynamic, ever-changing creation.

How scientific discoveries like evolution impact modern philosophy, ethics, and theology.
